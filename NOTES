Get rid of process_ and make the needed changes elsewhere.

Validate inputs to Read & Write:

For Write
* Assert that it's not more than the max buffer size.
For Read:
* Assert that the lookback and num_frames given aren't more than their maxima.
* Assert that read_pos is non-negative. Don't wrap.
* Assert that you won't be reading past how far has been written (track internally and update on Write & advancing the pointer).


Does NeedsRewind() need to be public?
You could do it during Write?
Same for GetReadPos and GetWritePos.
Make these private.

In the WaveNet Layer function, just give it its own Reset() method instead of giving access to its conv.

In the WaveNet layer array, stop using the i_start that's associated with ad hoc ring buffers. Instead, clean up the arrays that are passed.

Instead of _layer_buffers, use _rechannel.GetOutput() to get it started.

There's a bunch of "we can simplify once...". Do that simplification.

In test_conv1d::test_process_basic(), assert that the answer is numerically accurate. Same with test_process_dilation() and test_process_multiple_calls()

In test_process_multichannel(), assert the channels on the second output sample as well.

In test_get_output_different_sizes(), assert that the appropriate slice of the 4-output matches the 2-output (the first 2 cols).

Make test_set_size_and_weights() have 2,3,5 instead of 1,1,2 in/out/kernel size.

Add validation for Advance() that it's not more than what's been written.

When is Rewind called? check that it's only during write.

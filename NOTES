Refactor all references to Conv1D::process_ to use Process() and GetOutput as appropriate.
Get rid of process_ and make the needed changes elsewhere.

There's a bunch of "we can simplify once...". Do that simplification.

In test_conv1d::test_process_basic(), assert that the answer is numerically accurate. Same with test_process_dilation() and test_process_multiple_calls()

In test_process_multichannel(), assert the channels on the second output sample as well.

In test_get_output_different_sizes(), assert that the appropriate slice of the 4-output matches the 2-output (the first 2 cols).

Make test_set_size_and_weights() have 2,3,5 instead of 1,1,2 in/out/kernel size.

Need to be sure that WaveNet is still RT-safe.

WaveNet tests are a mess. Need to fix.
